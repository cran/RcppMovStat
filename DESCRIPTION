Description: Provides several efficient functions to 
    calculate common moving (or rolling, running) statistics for both evenly and unevenly spaced time 
    series: moving average, moving median, moving maximum (minimum), and so on. Built on 'C++', these 
    functions are apparently more efficient than those written in a traditional 'R' way and also faster
    than others using package 'Rcpp'.
